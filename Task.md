## Task
Implement an application in the Python environment with the possibility of a 2D object (point, circle, quadrilateral, etc.) to move using a straight line trajectory, implemented with the help of the Bresenham algorithm
- Realize the movement of an object from one point to another in real time (animation)
  - The user must see the trajectory of the object
  - The end point must be visible to the user
  - The user must see the movement of the object
  - The user must be given the opportunity to set the start point and end point (with mouse clicks or text input fields) with the help of the user interface.
- Do not use the built-in methods for creating a straight line, use the Bresenham algorithm!
Built-in functions may be used to draw the object itself
- Console programs (no UI) will not be accepted.
